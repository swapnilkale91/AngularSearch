# Angular Full Text Search

This project displays the search results and uses (https://github.com/swapnilkale91/NodeSearch) as its backend.

## Running the app

Run `npm run start` to run the code and open `http://localhost:4200` on the browser.
It uses proxy config to avoid CORS error. Make sure [NodeSearch](https://github.com/swapnilkale91/NodeSearch) is running on 3000. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
